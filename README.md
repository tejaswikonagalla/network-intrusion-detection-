Cybercrime has become a significant issue. Machine learning algorithms will help to identify cyber attacks such as network intrusion.This project mainly focuses on identifying the attackers using Machine   Learning Algorithms such as KNN, Decision trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression .The primary objective is to detect and identify network intrusions and malicious activities accurately.This project helps in detecting non-users/unauthorized users in a network.It involves monitoring network traffic and recognizing patterns or anomalies that may indicate security breaches.
In a world full of rapid usage of technology ,there are many attacks taking place such as DOS, DDOS, Phishing etc.,If there is no proper monitoring then data inconsistencies, stealing of data and attacking the users in the network might happen.It monitors a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users.
